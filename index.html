    This is a grid based game that uses division, the player controls the number in the green square. When the player
    moves to a new spot the number in that spot is divided by the player’s number. <br><br>

    The way division works in this game is modified. When a smaller number is divided by a larger number for example 18
    / 70 = 0.25, then the decimal is shifted to the right resulting in 2.5 replacing 18 with 2 and 70 with 5. The
    player’s spot will be 5 and the player’s previous spot will be 2. <br><br>

    However, when a larger number is divided by a smaller number the result will be the ones decimal place and the
    tenths decimal place, for example 98 / 42 = 2.3333, then 98 = 2 and 42 = 3. The player’s spot will be 2 and the
    player’s previous spot will be 3, there is no rounding.<br><br>

    You are trying to zero out the board, with your last remaining number as small as possible before hitting submit.
    This will give you your lowest possible penalty which is your greatest score. <br> <br>

    You are allowed to undo one move, you can also undo adding or subtracting from a number but only if you haven’t
    moved yet. <br><br>

    The player can move in any direction, up, down, left, and right. The player can also add or subtract from the number
    in the green square by pressing the plus or minus buttons. <br><br>
